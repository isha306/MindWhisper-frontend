        <p className='text-black mt-2 ml-60'>3. Rest your belly between your thighs and root your forehead to the floor. Relax the shoulders, jaw, and eyes. If it is not comfortable to place the forehead on the floor, rest it on a block or two stacked fists. There is an energy point at the center of the forehead in between the eyebrows that stimulates the vagus nerve and supports a "rest and digest" response. Finding a comfortable place for the forehead is key to gaining this soothing benefit.</p>
          <p className='text-black mt-2 ml-60'>4. Stretch your arms in front of you with the palms toward the floor or bring your arms back alongside your thighs with the palms facing upwards. You can also stretch the arms forward with palms facing up for a shoulder release or try bending the elbows so that the palms touch and rest the thumbs at the back of the neck. In this position inch the elbows forward. </p>
          <p className='text-black mt-2 ml-60'>5. Stay as long as you like, eventually reconnecting with the steady inhales and exhales of your breath. </p>

                <p className='text-black mt-2 ml-60'>1. Begin by sitting on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you and hands at your sides. For extra cushioning, consider sitting on a yoga mat or blanket. </p>
                <p className='text-black mt-2 ml-60'>2. Bend your left knee and bring your left heel close to your body by your groin area.</p>

                <p className='text-black mt-2 ml-60'>4. From this position, inhale and while you exhale, lift your right foot and place it just above your left ankle. Bring your right heel into your groin area. This step should feel comfortable. Do not force it. </p>
                <p className='text-black mt-2 ml-60'>5. Slide the toes of your right foot into the space between the left calf muscles. This will help to keep your posture steady. </p>
                <p className='text-black mt-2 ml-60'>6. Take your hands from your sides and place them palms down on the knees. Your knees should touch the floor. You can also stretch your arms straight to the sides and rest the backs of your palms or wrists on your knees, so your palms face upwards. If you cannot do this or you experience discomfort, use one of the modifications until you have more flexibility in your hips. </p>
                <p className='text-black mt-2 ml-60'>7. Sit upright with your gaze facing forward. There should be a nice, straight line from the top of your head to the floor.</p>
                <p className='text-black mt-2 ml-60'>8. Stay here and breathe deeply for one minute or longer. </p>

                <h1 className=' flex  text-[30px] mt-10  font-Salsa flex-col  '>Benefits:</h1>
     <p className='text-black mt-2 '>* The Siddhasana pose stretches the hips, adductors, knees, and ankles. When done correctly, it also helps direct energy from your lower body upward through the spine, which results in a flat back, upright posture, and long spine. </p>
     <p className='text-black mt-2 '>* You will gain the most benefits from the Siddhasana by staying in the position for long holds while practicing deep breathing. This allows you to focus on the tighter areas of your hips and through slow, mindful breathing, gradually open this area each time you perform the pose. </p>
     <p className='text-black mt-2 '>* Practicing Siddhasana on a regular basis may help reduce stress levels and decrease the symptoms associated with anxiety. Plus, sitting in a meditative pose while practicing deep breathing helps to ground you and encourages both physical and mental relief from the daily stressors of life. </p>

                <h1 className=' flex text-center text-[30px] mt-10 font-Salsa flex-col '> How To Do </h1>
                <p className='text-black mt-2 ml-60'>1. The Sukhasana posture is the starting point for Parivrtta Sukhasana. To perform Sukhasana, start by sitting on the floor with legs extended in front of you. Now fold the legs and assume the cross legged position. This is Sukhasana or the easy pose. </p>
                <p className='text-black mt-2 ml-60'>2. Sit straight with the spine and back erect and breathe normally. </p>
                <p className='text-black mt-2 ml-60'>3. Now, place the right palm on the floor to the right of the hips with fingers pointing outwards. </p>
                <p className='text-black mt-2 ml-60'>4. Slowly start exhaling and turn the upper body to the right along with the neck. Simultaneously move the left hand to the right knee. Exhale completely and twist the torso further to the right. The neck can turn and look back over the shoulders. </p>
                <p className='text-black mt-2 ml-60'>5. Make sure the spine is straight and the head is pulled up during the twist. Imagine that the twist is happening using the spine as an axis pole. </p>
                <p className='text-black mt-2 ml-60'>6. Maintain this position for as long as comfortable. You can do breathe slow shallow breaths in this position. </p>
                <p className='text-black mt-2 ml-60'>7. To release the position, inhale and slowly turn the upper body along with the neck to the left and come back to the normal sitting position. The hands come back to the normal position over the thighs or knees. </p>
                <p className='text-black mt-2 ml-60'>8. Repeat this process on the left side too. This constitutes one round of the practice. </p>
                <p className='text-black mt-2 ml-60'>9. Do as many rounds as you are comfortable. </p>

     <p className='text-black mt-2 '>* It tones the organs in the abdomen and improves metabolism.</p>
     <p className='text-black mt-2 '>* It stretches the upper chest and shoulders and can relieve shoulder pain.</p>
     <p className='text-black mt-2 '>* Parivrtta Sukhasana increases the flexibility of the back muscles and the spine.</p>
     <p className='text-black mt-2 '>* Parivrtta Sukhasana energizes the nervous system and releases stress and anxiety.</p>
     <p className='text-black mt-2 '>* It makes the neck muscles flexible. However, there is a word of caution for those suffering from spondylitis or severe neck pain. They should not twist the neck beyond the point where it starts to pain. By practicing this pose, one will eventually be able to turn the neck more without pain. Also, the process of twisting should be done as slowly as possible.</p>
