          Bipolar disorder (formerly called manic-depressive illness or manic depression) is a mental illness that causes unusual shifts in a person’s mood, energy, activity levels, and concentration. These shifts can make it difficult to carry out day-to-day tasks.A disorder associated with episodes of mood swings ranging from depressive lows to manic highs.
The exact cause of bipolar disorder isn't known, but a combination of genetics, environment and altered brain structure and chemistry may play a role.
Manic episodes may include symptoms such as high energy, reduced need for sleep and loss of touch with reality. Depressive episodes may include symptoms such as low energy, low motivation and loss of interest in daily activities. Mood episodes last days to months at a time and may also be associated with suicidal thoughts.
Treatment is usually lifelong and often involves a combination of medications and psychotherapy.

          <div className='flex items-center text-center flex-col text-lg  '>
           <p className='text-2xl font-medium py-6 '>There are several types of bipolar disorders, including: </p>
           <p className='text-lg font-medium py-2'>Bipolar I disorder:</p> <p className='text-justify' >People with bipolar I disorder have experienced one or more episodes of mania. Most people with bipolar I will have episodes of both mania and depression, but an episode of depression isn’t necessary for a diagnosis. The depressive episodes usually last at least two weeks. To be diagnosed with bipolar I, your manic episodes must last at least seven days or be so severe that you need hospitalization. People with bipolar I can also experience mixed states (episodes of both manic and depressive symptoms).</p>
           <p className='text-lg font-medium py-2'>Bipolar II disorder: </p> <p className='text-justify'>People with bipolar II experience depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes. But they never experience a full manic episode that’s characteristic of bipolar I disorder. While hypomania is less impairing than mania, bipolar II disorder is often more debilitating than bipolar I disorder due to chronic depression being more common in bipolar II.</p>
           <p className='text-lg font-medium py-2'>Cyclothymic disorder (cyclothymia):</p> <p className='text-justify'>People with cyclothymic disorder have a chronically unstable mood state. They experience hypomania and mild depression for at least two years. People with cyclothymia may have brief periods of normal mood (euthymia), but these periods last fewer than eight weeks. </p>
           <p className='text-lg font-medium py-2'>Other specified and unspecified bipolar and related disorders:</p> <p className='text-justify'>If a person doesn’t meet the diagnostic criteria for bipolar I, II or cyclothymia but has still experienced periods of clinically significant abnormal mood elevation, it’s considered other specified or unspecified bipolar disorder. </p>

          <p className='text-xl font-normal py-6 '>Scientists don’t yet know the exact cause of bipolar disorder.

But they do believe there’s a strong genetic (inherited) component. Bipolar disorder is considered one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions — more than two-thirds of people with bipolar disorder have at least one close biological relative with the condition. However, just because you have a biological relative with bipolar disorder, doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll also develop it.

Other factors that scientists think contribute to the development of bipolar disorder include:</p>

          <li className='text-justify text-xl font-medium py-2'>Changes in your brain: <p className='font-normal'>Researchers have identified subtle differences in the average size or activation of some brain structures in people with bipolar disorder.

          <li className='text-justify text-xl font-medium py-2'>Genetic factors: <p className='font-normal'>Bipolar disorder is more common in people who have a family member with the condition. Several genetic features may be involved. </p></li>
