          What is Schizophrenia?

          Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. People with schizophrenia may seem like they have lost touch with reality, which can be distressing for them and for their family and friends. The symptoms of schizophrenia can make it difficult to participate in usual, everyday activities, but effective treatments are available. Many people who receive treatment can engage in school or work, achieve independence, and enjoy personal relationships.

<p className='mt-4 text-lg font-medium'>The complexity of schizophrenia may help explain why there are misconceptions about the disease. Schizophrenia does not mean split personality or multiple-personality. Most people with schizophrenia are not any more dangerous or violent than people in the general population. While limited mental health resources in the community may lead to homelessness and frequent hospitalizations, it is a misconception that people with schizophrenia end up homeless or living in hospitals. Most people with schizophrenia live with their family, in group homes or on their own.</p>
       <p className='mt-4 text-lg font-medium'>Research has shown that schizophrenia affects men and women fairly equally but may have an earlier onset in males. Rates are similar around the world. People with schizophrenia are more likely to die younger than the general population, largely because of high rates of co-occurring medical conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes.</p>

          Types of schizophrenia
          </div>
          <div className='flex items-center text-center flex-col text-lg  '>
           <p className='text-2xl font-medium py-6 '>There are several types of schizophrenia, including: </p>
           <p className='text-lg font-medium py-2 '>Paranoid schizophrenia:</p> <p className='text-justify' >This is the most common type of schizophrenia. It may develop later in life than other forms. Symptoms include hallucinations and/or delusions, but your speech and emotions may not be affected.</p>
           <p className='text-lg font-medium py-2'>Hebephrenic schizophrenia:</p> <p className='text-justify'>Also known as ‘disorganised schizophrenia’, this type of schizophrenia typically develops when you’re 15-25 years old. Symptoms include disorganised behaviours and thoughts, alongside short-lasting delusions and hallucinations. You may have disorganised speech patterns and others may find it difficult to understand you.
        People living with disorganised schizophrenia often show little or no emotions in their facial expressions, voice tone, or mannerisms.</p>
           <p className='text-lg font-medium py-2'>Catatonic schizophrenia:</p> <p className='text-justify'>This is the rarest schizophrenia diagnosis, characterised by unusual, limited and sudden movements. You may often switch between being very active or very still. You may not talk much, and you may mimic other’s speech and movement. </p>
           <p className='text-lg font-medium py-2 '>Undifferentiated schizophrenia:</p> <p className='text-justify' >Your diagnosis may have some signs of paranoid, hebephrenic or catatonic schizophrenia, but it doesn’t obviously fit into one of these types alone.</p>
           <p className='text-lg font-medium py-2'>Residual schizophrenia:</p> <p className='text-justify'>You may be diagnosed with residual schizophrenia if you have a history of psychosis, but only experience the negative symptoms (such as slow movement, poor memory, lack of concentration and poor hygiene).  </p>
           <p className='text-lg font-medium py-2'>Simple schizophrenia:</p> <p className='text-justify'>Simple schizophrenia is rarely diagnosed in the UK. Negative symptoms (such as slow movement, poor memory, lack of concentration and poor hygiene) are most prominent early and worsen, while positive symptoms (such as hallucinations, delusions, disorganised thinking) are rarely experienced. </p>

           <p className='text-lg font-medium py-6 text-justify'>There’s no one single cause of schizophrenia. Experts suspect schizophrenia happens for different reasons. The three main reasons include:</p>

        <div>
          <li className='text-justify text-xl'>Imbalances in chemical signals your brain uses for cell-to-cell communication.</li>

          <div className='flex items-center text-center flex-col '>
          <p className='text-xl font-normal py-6 '>Many people with schizophrenia can’t recognize that they have symptoms of schizophrenia. But those around you might. These are the five main symptoms of schizophrenia</p>
        </div>
        <div >
          <li className='text-justify text-xl font-medium py-2'>Delusions:  <p className='font-normal'> These are false beliefs that you hold even when there’s plenty of evidence that those beliefs are wrong. For example, you might think that someone is controlling what you think, say or do.</p></li>
         <li className='text-justify text-xl font-medium py-2'>Hallucinations: <p className='font-normal'>  You still think you can see, hear, smell, touch or taste things that don’t exist, like hearing voices. </p></li>
          <li className='text-justify text-xl font-medium py-2'>Disorganized or incoherent speaking:<p className='font-normal'> You may have trouble organizing your thoughts while speaking. This might look like trouble staying on topic, or your thoughts might be so jumbled that people can’t understand you. </p></li>
          <li className='text-justify text-xl font-medium py-2'>Disorganized or unusual movements:<p className='font-normal'>You might move differently than people around you expect. For example, you may turn around a lot for no clear reason, or you might not move much at all. </p></li>
          <li className='text-justify text-xl font-medium py-2'>Negative symptoms:  <p className='font-normal'>These refer to a reduction or loss of your ability to do things as expected. For example, you might stop making facial expressions, or speak with a flat, emotionless voice. Negative symptoms also include a lack of motivation, especially when you don’t want to socialize or do things you ordinarily enjoy. </p></li>

          Getting treatment for schizophrenia
          </div> 
          <div className='flex items-center text-justify flex-col text-lg   '>
           <p className='text-xl font-normal py-6 text-justify'>Treating schizophrenia usually involves a combination of medication, therapy and self-management techniques. These include: </p>
         </div>
         <div >
          <li className='text-justify text-xl font-medium py-2'>Antipsychotics: <p className='font-normal'> These medications block how your brain uses certain chemicals for cell-to-cell communication. </p></li>
         <li className='text-justify text-xl font-medium py-2'>Psychotherapy: <p className='font-normal'>Talk therapy methods like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can help you cope with and manage your condition. Long-term therapy can also help with secondary problems alongside schizophrenia, such as anxiety, depression or substance use issues. </p></li>
          <li className='text-justify text-xl font-medium py-2'>Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT):<p className='font-normal'>If other treatments don’t work, your provider may recommend ECT. This treatment involves using an electrical current applied to your scalp, which then stimulates certain parts of your brain. The stimulation causes a brief seizure, which can help improve brain function if you have severe depression, agitation and other problems. If you have ECT, you receive anesthesia. You’ll be asleep for this procedure and won’t feel any pain.</p></li>
          <li className='text-justify text-xl font-medium py-2'>Other medications: <p className='font-normal'>Your healthcare provider might also prescribe other medications to symptoms that happen alongside or because of your schizophrenia symptoms. They might also prescribe medications to help reduce side effects of antipsychotic medications such as tremors.</p></li>
