          Dementia is the loss of cognitive functioning — thinking, remembering, and reasoning — to such an extent that it interferes with a person's daily life and activities. Some people with dementia cannot control their emotions, and their personalities may change. Dementia ranges in severity from the mildest stage, when it is just beginning to affect a person's functioning, to the most severe stage, when the person must depend completely on others for basic activities of daily living, such as feeding oneself.
        Dementia affects millions of people and is more common as people grow older (about one-third of all people age 85 or older may have some form of dementia) but it is not a normal part of aging. Many people live into their 90s and beyond without any signs of dementia.

          <div className='flex items-center text-center flex-col text-lg  '>
           <p className='text-2xl font-medium py-6 '> Types of dementia are: </p>
           <p className='text-lg font-medium py-2'>Alzheimer’s disease:</p> <p className='text-justify' >This is the most common cause of dementia.
           Although not all causes of Alzheimer's disease are known, experts do know that a small percentage are related to changes in three genes. These gene changes can be passed down from parent to child. While several genes are probably involved in Alzheimer's disease, one important gene that increases risk is apolipoprotein E4 (APOE).</p>
           <p className='text-lg font-medium py-2'>Frontotemporal dementia:</p> <p className='text-justify'>This is a group of diseases characterized by the breakdown of nerve cells and their connections in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. These areas are associated with personality, behavior and language. Common symptoms affect behavior, personality, thinking, judgment, language and movement.</p>
           <p className='text-lg font-medium py-2'>Lewy body dementia:</p> <p className='text-justify'> Lewy bodies are balloonlike clumps of protein. They have been found in the brains of people with Lewy body dementia, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Lewy body dementia is one of the more common types of dementia. </p>
           <p className='text-lg font-medium py-2'>Vascular dementia:</p> <p className='text-justify'>This type of dementia is caused by damage to the vessels that supply blood to the brain. Blood vessel problems can cause stroke or affect the brain in other ways, such as by damaging the fibers in the white matter of the brain.</p>

          <div className='flex items-center text-center flex-col '>
          <p className='text-lg font-normal py-3 text-justify'>Dementia is caused by damage to or loss of nerve cells and their connections in the brain. The symptoms depend on the area of the brain that's damaged. Dementia can affect people differently.</p>
          <p className='text-lg font-normal py-3 text-justify'>Dementias are often grouped by what they have in common. They may be grouped by the protein or proteins deposited in the brain or by the part of the brain that's affected. Also, some diseases have symptoms like those of dementia. And some medicines can cause a reaction that includes dementia symptoms. Not getting enough of certain vitamins or minerals also can cause dementia symptoms. When this occurs, dementia symptoms may improve with treatment.</p>

           <p className='text-lg font-normal py-6 text-justify'>Signs and symptoms of dementia result when once-healthy neurons (nerve cells) in the brain stop working, lose connections with other brain cells, and die. While everyone loses some neurons as they age, people with dementia experience far greater loss.
                                            The signs and symptoms can vary depending on the type and may include: </p>

</p>

         <div >
          <li className='text-justify text-xl font-medium py-2'>Cholinesterase inhibitors: <p className='font-normal'>These medicines work by boosting levels of a chemical messenger involved in memory and judgment. They include donepezil (Aricept, Adlarity), rivastigmine (Exelon) and galantamine (Razadyne ER).
        Although primarily used to treat Alzheimer's disease, these medicines also might be prescribed for other dementias. They might be prescribed for people with vascular dementia, Parkinson's disease dementia and Lewy body dementia.
      Side effects can include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Other possible side effects include slowed heart rate, fainting and sleep problems.</p></li>
         <li className='text-justify text-xl font-medium py-2'>Memantine: <p className='font-normal'>Memantine (Namenda) works by regulating the activity of glutamate. Glutamate is another chemical messenger involved in brain functions such as learning and memory. Memantine is sometimes prescribed with a cholinesterase inhibitor.
        A common side effect of memantine is dizziness.</p></li>
          <li className='text-justify text-xl font-medium py-2'>Other medicines:<p className='font-normal'> You might take other medicines to treat symptoms or other conditions. You may need treatment for depression, sleep problems, hallucinations, parkinsonism or agitation.</p></li>
