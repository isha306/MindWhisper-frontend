          Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental and behavioral disorder that develops from experiencing a traumatic event, such as sexual assault, warfare, traffic collisions, child abuse, domestic violence, or other threats on a person's life or well-being. Symptoms may include disturbing thoughts, feelings, or dreams related to the events, mental or physical distress to trauma-related cues, attempts to avoid trauma-related cues, alterations in the way a person thinks and feels, and an increase in the fight-or-flight response. These symptoms last for more than a month after the event. Young children are less likely to show distress, but instead may express their memories through play. A person with PTSD is at a higher risk of suicide and intentional self-harm.

          Types of post-traumatic stress disorder (Ptsd) 
          </div>
          <div className='flex items-center text-center flex-col text-lg  '>
           <p className='text-2xl font-medium py-6 '>There are several types of Ptsd, including: </p>
           <p className='text-lg font-medium py-2'>Normal Stress Response:</p> <p className='text-justify' >Normal stress response is what occurs before PTSD begins. However, it does not always lead up to the full-blown disorder. For example, events like accidents, injuries, illnesses, surgeries and other sources of unreasonable amounts of tension and stress can all lead to this response. Typically, normal stress response can be effectively managed with the support of loved ones, peers and individual or group therapy sessions. Individuals suffering from normal stress response should see a recovery within a few weeks.</p>
           <p className='text-lg font-medium py-2'>Acute Stress Disorder:</p> <p className='text-justify'>Acute stress disorder, while not the same as PTSD, can occur in people who have been exposed to what is or what feels like a life-threatening event. Natural disasters, loss of loved ones, loss of a job or risk of death are all stressors that can trigger acute stress disorder. If left untreated, acute stress disorder may actually develop into PTSD. Acute stress disorder can be treated through individual and group therapy, medication and intensive treatments designed by a psychiatrist.</p>
           <p className='text-lg font-medium py-2'>Uncomplicated PTSD:</p> <p className='text-justify'>Uncomplicated PTSD is linked to one major traumatic event, versus multiple events, and is the easiest form of PTSD to treat. Symptoms of uncomplicated PTSD include: avoidance of trauma reminders, nightmares, flashbacks to the event, irritability, mood changes and changes in relationships. Uncomplicated PTSD can be treated through therapy, medication or a combination of both. </p>
           <p className='text-lg font-medium py-2'>Complex PTSD:</p> <p className='text-justify'>Complex PTSD is the opposite of uncomplicated PTSD. It is caused by multiple traumatic events, not just one. Complex PTSD is common in abuse or domestic violence cases, repeated exposure to war or community violence, or sudden loss. While they share the same symptoms, treatment of complex PTSD is a little more intense than uncomplicated PTSD. For example, individuals with complex PTSD can be diagnosed with borderline or antisocial personality disorder or dissociative disorders. They exhibit behavioral issues, such as impulsivity, aggression, substance abuse or sexual impulsivity. They can also exhibit extreme emotional issues, such as intense rage, depression or panic. </p>
           <p className='text-lg font-medium py-2'>Comorbid PTSD:</p> <p className='text-justify'>Comorbid PTSD is a blanket term for co-occurring disorders. It is applied when a person has more than one mental health concern, often coupled with substance abuse issues. Comorbid PTSD is extremely common, as many people suffer from more than one condition at a time. Best results are achieved when both the commingling mental health condition and the comorbid PTSD are treated at the same time. Many people who suffer from any of the five types of PTSD try to treat it on their own. This can include self-medication and other destructive behaviors. Using drugs or alcohol as a way to numb the pain will only make things worse and prolong treatment. It’s critical for your own mental health to gain an understanding of which type of PTSD you believe you are feeling and make a decision to get the guidance needed for healing.  </p>

          <li className='text-justify text-xl'>Changes in arousal and reactivity, including being easily irritated, experiencing angry outbursts; behaving recklessly or in a self-destructive manner; being hypervigilant or easily startled; or having difficulties concentrating or sleeping</li>

           <p className='text-xl font-normal py-6 text-justify'>Psychotherapy (talk therapy) is the main treatment for PTSD, especially forms of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).This therapy takes place with a trained, licensed mental health professional, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist. They can provide support, education and guidance to you and/or your loved ones to help you function better and increase your well-being. Specific forms of CBT for PTSD include: </p>
         </div>
         <div >
          <li className='text-justify text-xl font-medium py-2'>Cognitive processing therapy: <p className='font-normal'> This therapy was designed specifically to treat PTSD. It focuses on changing painful negative emotions (like shame and guilt) and beliefs due to the trauma. It also helps you confront distressing memories and emotions. </p></li>
         <li className='text-justify text-xl font-medium py-2'>Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy: <p className='font-normal'>This method involves moving your eyes a specific way while you process traumatic memories. EMDR’s goal is to help you heal from trauma or other distressing life experiences. Compared to other therapy methods, EMDR is relatively new. But dozens of clinical trials show this technique is effective and can help a person faster than many other methods. </p></li>
          <li className='text-justify text-xl font-medium py-2'>Group therapy:<p className='font-normal'> This type of therapy encourages survivors of similar traumatic events to share their experiences and feelings in a comfortable and nonjudgmental setting. Family therapy may also help, as challenges of PTSD can affect the entire family. </p></li>
          <li className='text-justify text-xl font-medium py-2'>Prolonged exposure therapy: <p className='font-normal'>This therapy uses repeated, detailed imagining of the trauma or progressive exposures to symptom triggers in a safe, controlled way. This helps you face and gain control of fear and learn to cope. </p></li>
          <li className='text-justify text-xl font-medium py-2'> Trauma-focused CBT: <p className='font-normal'> This therapy involves learning about how your body responds to trauma and stress. You’ll also identify and reframe problematic thinking patterns and learn symptom management skills. It involves exposure therapy, as well. </p></li>
